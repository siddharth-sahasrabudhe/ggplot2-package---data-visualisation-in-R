### What is Heat Map?

A heat map (or heatmap) is a 2-dimensional data visualization technique that represents the magnitude of individual values within a dataset as a color. By observing how cell colors change across each axis, you can observe if there are any patterns in value for one or both variables.

```{r,out.width='75%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Heat Map Example'}
knitr::include_graphics('Screenshot 03-01-2024 15.08.13.png')

```

### Load the Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

### Load the Data-set

```{r}
head(flights)%>%view
```

### Transform the data-set

```{r}
flights_DL <- flights %>%
  filter(carrier=="DL")%>%
  select(carrier,arr_delay,origin,dest)%>%
  view
```

### Draw the heat map

```{r}
ggplot(flights_DL, aes(x = origin, y = dest, fill = arr_delay))+
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "black")+
 theme_classic()
```

### What is Correlogram?

Correlogram displays the correlation coefficient for all possible combinations of two variables in the data set.

### Transform the data-set

```{r}
flights_corr <- flights %>%
  filter(carrier=="DL")%>% 
  inner_join(weather)%>%
  drop_na()%>%
  view
```

### Filter the data-set

```{r}
flights_corr <- flights_corr %>%
  select(arr_delay,dep_delay,starts_with("wind"),temp,distance,dewp,pressure,visib)%>%
  view
```

### Install the package and load the library to plot correlogram

```{r}
#install.packages("ggcorrplot")
library(ggcorrplot)
```

### Calculate correlation coefficients

```{r}
flights_corr_matrix <- round(cor(flights_corr),2)%>%
  view
```

### Plot correlogram

```{r}
ggcorrplot(flights_corr_matrix , 
 method = "square", 
 outline.color = "black",
 lab_size = 4,
 lab = TRUE)
```

### Summary:

-   A heat map (or heatmap) is a 2-dimensional data visualization technique that represents the magnitude of individual values within a dataset as a color.
-   By observing how cell colors change across each axis, you can observe if there are any patterns in value for one or both variables.
-   Heat map is created using `geom_tile()` object
-   There is another version of heat map called as correlogram.
-   Correlogram displays the correlation coefficient for all possible combinations of two variables in the data set.
-   We used `ggcorrplot` package to plot the correlogram
-   We calculated correlation between variables using `corr` function and then passed these values as arguments to `ggcorrplot` function to plot the correlogram.
-   Each value on correlogram denotes how strong the association is between two variables.
